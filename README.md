# EGCI113

### Hello! Welcome to Fundamental Computer Programming

This is the guide for absolute beginners who just started programming for the first time.

The content is based on **EGCI113** course, but I might try to take different approaches to explain certain topics.

In the end, all you need from this course is being able to use C programming languages to solve tedious problem algorithmically.

With that in mind, sometimes solving problems are not as straightforward as telling computer what we want, but it is breaking down our needs to several steps for computers to follow and satisfy our needs.
